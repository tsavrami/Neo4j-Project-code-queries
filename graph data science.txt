// GDS 'stream' mode: returns algorithm computation as result rows.
// Which can include 'tuple' of the node's id and the result, or the ids of the nodes and their result (like a similarity score)
// Basically this is how we make tables from graphs...



// GDS 'stats' mode: returns statistical results of the algorithm as a single row. Parent to mutate and write.
// IGNORE 



// GDS 'mutate' mode: for manipulation within the projected graph
// Neo4j website/documentation says it's especially useful in these ways:
// - Giving its output to a subsequent algorithm (good for helper 'methods')
// - Adding its output to the database (adding new attributes and nodes, etc.)
// - Or for general calculations, its results can be entirely queried (results can output to the console)



// GDS 'write' mode: for manipulation external to the projected graph (its database)
// - Giving its output to multiple other algorithms (because it makes another graph)
